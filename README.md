# Linkup 
- Linkup is a full stack application that helps users stay better connected to their loved ones. This is my first project utilizing python/django. The purpose of this project was to learn more about the language and framework in use, and my hope was to gain some familiarity with how they function as a back-end technology - still a continuing work in progress.

## Project Description

As the world quickly got thrown into the chaos of COVID, many status quos were dynamically shifted. An absurd number of people across the globe saw negative impacts to too many parts of their lives, all at once. One of these facets was the dissolution of social connections, which has been a detriment to the mental well-being of a widespread population - an issue that is often deprioritized in lieu of more pressing or 'pragmatic' problems. Human beings are by nature communal creatures at our core and I want to leverage technology to address a basic need that society often deems simply extracurricular. I hope that this application will serve as a useful tool to help people gather together and engage one another to form progressively more genuine connections. 

## This is the front-end repository. The full README and the back-end repository can be found below.
